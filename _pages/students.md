First and foremost, it is important to state that you are completely free to suggest your own topic. Topics listed here are mainly _suggestions_, partially in line with what I do my [research](/research) in or I have experience with. Either way, if you are interested in something else and you think that I can help you out with that, feel free to drop me an e-mail. Let's talk :)

### Compilers - Part 1.

- I'm particularly interested in compilers within the context of heterogeneous and embedded computing systems, be it designing novel programming languages or transformations that aid programming of such systems.
- This section is to be filled with additional details in due time :)
- If you would like to join a currently forming compiler development team, drop me an email.

### Compilers - Part 2.

- You can plug into some of the research I'm doing right now. Check out my [research](/research) subpage.
- Right now, I'm aiming into extending support for advanced memory management schemes in [RISE](https://rise-lang.org/) for the GAP8, a heterogeneous platform I delivered support for in RISE.
- You might wanna try putting GAP8's Hardware Convolution Engine (HWCE) to good use by utilizing it in a real-world application, like Sobel filter.
- There is also a new project proposal underway with a partner at the University of Ljubljana. Briefly, the project will hopefully aim to extend support for approximate computing accelerators in [RISE](https://rise-lang.org/). Rumours say that such accelerators will be integrated into [HERO](https://pulp-platform.org/hero.html) platform.
- Let's try something with the [OpenPiton](https://parallel.princeton.edu/openpiton/)...
- ...or maybe with any of the [PULP](https://pulp-platform.org/) systems :)

### Biomedical systems and sensing

- Nowadays I'm kickstarting the development of a full-scale biomedical system. The system in question will feature multiple components on hardware and software layers including:
  - sensing equipment produced by our partners
  - embedded devices as middlemen between sensors and mobile devices
  - web services and mobile applications
  - machine learning models
- There is lots of work to be done on each of the aforementioned components. If you are interested in biomedical systems with real-life applications, feel free to contact me for more details :)

### Social and political processes modeling and simulation

- Election simulation
- Political rating modeling
- Maybe out there are some other processes that you would like to model and simulate? :)

### Parallelization and HPC programming

- Parallelization of various problems
- Do you have an application that you would like to run on an HPC? Optimization, parallelization, and running the application in question on an actual HPC could be your topic :)

### Heterogeneous systems programming and utilization

- GPU programming
- Custom heterogeneous systems programming. This usually implies systems with accelerators for specific applications.

### Embedded systems

- Construction of embedded systems, IoT modules, and similar devices based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components
- Software development for embedded systems, microcontrollers, etc.
- Full bottom-up development of IoT solutions, from data-collecting modules or actuators to web services handling the application logic
- There is one concrete IoT application development in progress right now, you are free to join.

### Web services

- Automated student evaluation and grading systems
- You could always develop web services or full-stack web applications for whatever domain you want :)
