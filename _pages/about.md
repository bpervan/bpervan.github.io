I'm a Postdoctoral researcher at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing. My research interests are generally focused on the fields of parallelism, heterogeneous computing systems, compilers, and high-performance computing. I'm particularly interested in the programming of such systems, including through the means of domain-specific languages and functional programming, with the ultimate goal of increasing cumulative performance and energy efficiency. I'm also interested in embedded computing, in terms of systems development and software for embedded systems. I support open-source software, hardware, and community.

Generally, I have a rich experience in software development and system administration. Also, I'm keen to keep my software engineering skills up to date by occasionally developing software for a wide range of use cases, from web services to software for embedded devices. In the fields of computing systems and software engineering, I provide consultation services.

Students are very welcome to drop me an e-mail if they would like to work with me in any way, including supervision for bachelor and master projects/theses :) Please check my [students](/students) subpage for the **incomplete** (i. e. you are free to suggest your own topic) list of topics or fields.

I'm open to any kind of collaboration if your research interests cross mine in any way. Feel free to contact me :)
